 * Process flow for dispute resolution is outlined below
 *
 * 1. Initiate a transaction by calling the appropriate end point. An OrderID is generated which is returned as part of the JSON response.
 *
 * 2. Retrieve the OrderID and pass it as a parameter to our Query API to get the status of the order.
 *
 * 3. If the order fails, then pass the OrderID retrieved in stage two(2) above to our CANCEL API  to cancel the transaction.
